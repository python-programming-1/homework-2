Replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME with your github username.

1. With a text editor, make a file called HW2.txt with the following text:

```

My name is XXX (put your name here). This is for homework 2.
```

2. Save the HW2.txt in the same folder as the README.md file, so that you have two files in the same folder.

3. Execute these commands inside the same folder as the README.md and HW2.txt

```
git add HW2.txt
git commit -a -m 'add HW2.txt'
git push -u origin master
```

4. click on https://github.com/python-programming-1/class-home-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME (replace YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME with your actual github username)

If you see HW2.txt and README.md on the website you've done the assignment, congratulations! If you don't see it, try to work with a classmate and backtrack, or submit a question in Canvas.
